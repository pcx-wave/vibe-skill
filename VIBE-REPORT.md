# /vibe-report

Run `~/tools/delegate-report` with any flags extracted from the arguments and display output verbatim.

| User says | Flag |
|-----------|------|
| "last 7 days", "7d" | `--since 7` |
| "last 30 days", "30d" | `--since 30` |
| "project foo" | `--project foo` |
| "only failures", "fails", "bugs" | `--fails` |
| "adapt", "adaptations", "by adaptation" | `--adapt` |
| "all delegates", "everything" | `--all` |
| "delegate foo", "only opencode" | `--delegate foo` |
| (nothing) | (no flags — vibe runs only) |

Defaults to vibe runs only. The run log is shared across delegate tools; `--all`
shows every delegate, `--delegate NAME` scopes to a specific one.
