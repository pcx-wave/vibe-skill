# Vibe Orchestrator

## /vibeon | /vibeoff | /vibestatus

Toggle auto-delegate mode — Vibe automatically handles coding tasks without requiring `/vibe` each time.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/vibeon` | `touch ~/.local/share/vibe-auto.flag` → confirm "Auto-vibe ON" |
| `/vibeoff` | `rm -f ~/.local/share/vibe-auto.flag` → confirm "Auto-vibe OFF" |
| `/vibestatus` | report auto-mode (ON/OFF) **and** active model override |

For `/vibestatus`, run both checks and print two lines:
```
Auto-vibe: ON | OFF
Model: <alias>  (override)  OR  Model: deepseek-flash  (config default)
```

### Auto-mode pre-filter (when flag is set)

When `vibe-auto.flag` exists, apply this gate **before** loading the full skill:

| Task signal | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 file, ≤10 lines, exact location already known | Edit directly — do NOT invoke the skill |
| Logic non-trivial, location unclear, multiple files, HTML/JS content, or >1 change | Invoke `/vibe` as normal |

---

## /vibe-report

If the user invokes `/vibe-report`, run `~/tools/delegate-report` with any flags
extracted from the arguments, display output verbatim, and stop.

| User says | Flag |
|-----------|------|
| "last 7 days", "7d" | `--since 7` |
| "last 30 days", "30d" | `--since 30` |
| "project foo" | `--project foo` |
| "only failures", "fails", "bugs" | `--fails` |
| "adapt", "adaptations", "by adaptation" | `--adapt` |
| "all delegates", "everything", "compare delegates" | `--all` |
| "delegate foo", "only opencode" | `--delegate foo` |
| (nothing) | (no flags — vibe runs only) |

The report defaults to **vibe runs only**. The log is shared across delegate
tools (vibe, opencode, gemini); use `--all` for the cross-delegate comparison
or `--delegate NAME` to scope to a different one.

---

## /vibe-model-pick | /vibe-model-clear

Override the Vibe model for all subsequent delegations without touching `~/.vibe/config.toml`.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/vibe-model-pick <alias>` | `echo <alias> > ~/.local/share/vibe-model.flag` → confirm |
| `/vibe-model-clear` | `rm -f ~/.local/share/vibe-model.flag` → confirm "back to config default" |

**Available aliases** (from `~/.vibe/config.toml`):

| Alias | Model | Provider | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| `deepseek-flash` | deepseek-v4-flash | DeepSeek | Default — fast, cheap; solid for inline edits |
| `mistral-medium-3.5` | mistral-vibe-cli-latest | Mistral | Stronger reasoning; reliable for inline edits |
| `devstral-small` | devstral-small-latest | Mistral | Agent-mode — read/explore only, weak at inline edits |
| `local` | devstral (llamacpp) | Local | Requires local server on :8080 |

Run the bash command, print one confirmation line showing the active model, and stop.

---

When the user invokes `/vibe <instruction>`, Claude delegates the implementation
to Mistral Vibe via its programmatic mode, supervises in real time, and reports.

---

## Known Limits

Hard constraints — not config options. Full details in `SKILL-reference.md`.

- **UTF-8 / special chars** → silent `search_replace` match failure. Use `python3 str.replace()` for accented chars or emoji.
- **Code duplication** → Vibe may re-insert a block already written. Grep for duplicate definitions after every run.
- **HTML in prompt** → tags like `<div>` are shell redirects (exit 127). Write HTML content to a temp file; reference the path in the prompt.
- **Source code in bash heredoc** → quotes/backslashes mangle. Use `search_replace` directly; never a helper script that replaces code.
- **Orchestration chain** → 6 failure points in order: CLI auth → pseudo-TTY → stream parser → TOML pricing → git diff → JSON log. When a run produces unexpected results, work down this list. Full details in `SKILL-reference.md`.

---

## Step 1 — Detect workdir

1. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in the current directory.
2. If ambiguous or no git repo → ask with `AskUserQuestion`.

---

## Step 2 — Decompose the task

**Critical rule**: keep tasks **atomic and focused** — one objective, one prompt.

| Size | Definition | Max turns | Approach |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Trivial** | 1 file, change is obvious and located | — | **Skip delegation — edit directly** |
| **Simple** | 1 file, non-trivial logic or unknown location | 5–8 | 1 vibe call |
| **Medium** | 2–3 related files, 1 objective | 8–12 | 1 structured vibe call |
| **Complex** | >3 files OR business logic OR DB migrations | — | **Break into sub-tasks** |

**Decomposition for complex tasks:**
```
Sub-task 1: Explore / read relevant files (read-only, 5 turns)
Sub-task 2: Implement change A in file X (8 turns)
Sub-task 3: Implement change B in file Y (8 turns)
Sub-task 4: Verify / test (5 turns)
```
→ Check git diff between each sub-task before launching the next.

---

## Step 3 — Write the Vibe prompt

The prompt must be **self-contained**.

**Structure:**
```
Stack: Python/Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
Key files: app.py (routes + fetch), models.py (Entry)

TASK: [one single thing to do, stated as an imperative]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [what must not break]
- [expected format if relevant]

VERIFY: grep for "def function_name" in file.py and confirm it exists.
```

**Formulation rules:**
- One task per prompt — never "also do X and Y"
- Name the exact files to modify
- Include a grep-based verification criterion (not a file re-read)
- Language: English (better Mistral performance)

**Prompt adaptations:**
- **Any task that defines or calls a specific function**: include the exact signature — `def validate(data: dict) -> tuple[bool, list[str]]:`.
- **No fixed signature, but conventions matter**: point at the file to read first ("read app.py, follow its route/jsonify style") instead — don't do both, they're substitutes.
- **Write/modify tasks**: append an output format block:
  ```
  OUTPUT FORMAT:
  Modified: <file>
  Does: <one line>
  No other prose.
  ```

> ⚠️ **Shell safety**: if the prompt contains UTF-8 accented chars, emojis,
> `:` in Python/YAML code, or typographic apostrophes — the vibe-delegate script
> passes them safely via a temp file (`printf %q`). Never interpolate such a prompt
> directly into a bash heredoc.

**Verification — always use grep, not file re-read:**
```
VERIFY: grep for "def extract_labels" in app.py and confirm it exists.
```

---

## Step 4 — Launch Vibe

```bash
~/tools/vibe-delegate "<workdir>" "<prompt>" [max-turns] [agent] [timeout-secs]
```

| Argument       | Default  | Notes                                           |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `workdir`      | —        | Absolute path, must exist                       |
| `prompt`       | —        | Self-contained task description                 |
| `max-turns`    | `10`     | Mistral turn limit — hard cap at 12, never more |
| `agent`        | *(none)* | See agent table below                           |
| `timeout-secs` | `180`    | Wall-clock kill timer                           |
| `--require STR` | *(none)* | Repeatable. Abort before launch if STR is absent in the workdir — pass the `search_replace` anchor here |
| `--with-review N` | *(none)* | After Vibe finishes, Claude reviews the diff and re-delegates fixes up to N times (see Step 8) |
| `--verbose` | *(off)* | Print per-token-type cost breakdown (input/output tokens × pricing) instead of the compact summary line |

**Available agents:**

| Agent | Use |
|-------|-----|
| *(default → `auto-approve`)* | General implementation — all tools run without approval |
| `code-reviewer` | Review only, no changes |
| `planner` | Planning before implementing |
| `code-architect` | Architecture design, read-only |

**Recommended max turns:**
- Read/explore: `5`
- Simple change (1 file): `8`
- Medium change (2–3 files): `12`
- Never exceed `12` — decompose instead

**Background launch:**
```bash
~/tools/vibe-delegate "<workdir>" "<prompt>" 10 > /tmp/vibe_out.txt 2>&1 &
# Monitor with: tail -f /tmp/vibe_out.txt
```

---

## Step 5 — Supervise in real time

The script prints live:
```
=== VIBE START ===
Workdir : /path/to/project
Agent   : default
Turns   : 10
Timeout : 180s
Prompt  : Stack: Python/Flask. File: app.py ...
===================
  [read]  app.py
  [tool]  file: app.py
  [tool]  search_replace [OK] ...
  [vibe]  Done. Converted date to datetime.date in fetch_data().
Tool calls: 5
Delegate tokens (run): 4,800  (last turn: 4,600+200)  |  cost ~$0.0086
Claude Sonnet 4.6 eq: same tokens would cost ~$0.0168  (ratio x2.0)
=== VIBE DONE (exit: 0) ===
=== SYNTAX OK (1 check(s)) ===

=== UNCOMMITTED CHANGES ===
 app.py | 4 ++--
[log] → ~/.local/share/delegate-runs.jsonl  (4800 tokens, exit 0, 34.2s)
```

**Vibe never commits.** All changes are left unstaged — `git checkout .` reverts everything if needed.

**Red flags to act on immediately:**

| Flag | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `[WARN]` | Vibe encountered an error | Read the error, fix manually |
| `[tool]  search_replace [FAIL]` | UTF-8 match failure | Edit manually with Python `str.replace()` |
| `exit: 1` or non-zero | Vibe failed / did not complete verification | Read diff, correct prompt |
| No `[tool]  file:` lines | `WROTE_NOTHING` — Vibe read but wrote nothing | Do not supply the code yourself. Follow Step 6 retry/escalation rules. |
| Mangled tool name in output (e.g. `write_filecepte`) | Vibe produced a garbled tool call — write never executed | Same as WROTE_NOTHING — treat as failed write. Follow Step 6. |
| `=== SYNTAX ERRORS ===` | Post-run syntax check failed | **Fix before committing** |
| Same file read 5+ times | Vibe is looping — run likely lost | Abort, check diff, try again |

**Known bugs and workarounds:**

| Bug | Cause | Fix |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Variable declared twice | Vibe doesn't check scope | Grep the variable before relaunching |
| Truncated prompt | Special chars in inline prompt | Script uses temp file — should be fixed |
| Wrote a Python helper just to replace code | Misdiagnosed search_replace limit | Use search_replace directly for ASCII code; write_file only if new content is too long for the prompt |
| Empty run — 0 files changed despite ≥3 tool calls | Multi-edit prompt: first `search_replace` target not found byte-for-byte | Split into sequential single-change runs; grep target string locally before delegating |

**If exit non-zero:** do not relaunch immediately. Read the diff, understand what was done, fix the prompt.

---

## Step 6 — Iteration

- **Max 3 attempts** per sub-task before escalating to the user.
- Between attempts, **read the git diff** to avoid doubling partial work.

### WROTE_NOTHING / failed write — auto-retry then escalate

When a run produces any of the following:
- No `[tool]  file:` lines (WROTE_NOTHING)
- Mangled tool call output (e.g. `write_filecepte`, `search_replacecepte`)
- Non-zero exit with 0 files changed

**Do not write the code yourself.** Revise the prompt (simpler target, explicit file path, shorter scope) and re-run. This counts against the 3-attempt limit.

If all 3 attempts produce WROTE_NOTHING or failed writes, stop and ask the user:

```
⛔ Vibe wrote nothing after 3 attempts — halting chain.
  File expected : <path>
  Failure signal: <WROTE_NOTHING | mangled write | exit N, 0 files>
  Sub-task      : <description>

Options:
  (r) Revise prompt manually and retry
  (g) Allow ghostwriting for this sub-task (--allow-ghostwriting)
  (a) Abort
```

Do not proceed to subsequent sub-tasks until resolved.

### `--allow-ghostwriting` opt-in

When the user passes `--allow-ghostwriting` to `/vibe`, Claude may write the content and delegate only the file-write step to Vibe. **The Step 7 report must then explicitly list ghostwritten files:**

```
Files ghostwritten (Claude-authored, Vibe wrote):
  - path/to/file.ext
```

Ghostwritten files must be listed separately from Vibe-authored files. Do not silently mix them.

---

## Step 7 — Report to the user

```
✓ Vibe finished — <1-line summary>

Files modified:
  - path/to/file.ext (+X / -Y lines)

[If problem]:
⚠ <description> — completing manually / relaunching?

Ready to commit?
```

**When `--verbose` was passed:** after the file list, quote the full token/cost block verbatim from the script output — the lines starting with `Model`, `  Input`, `  Output`, `  Total`, `  Claude`. Do not paraphrase or summarize them. Example:

```
Model               : mistral-medium-3.5
  Input  :     45,120  @  $1.50/M  = $0.0677
  Output :      1,280  @  $7.50/M  = $0.0096
  Total  :     46,400              = $0.0773
  Claude :     46,400  (@ $3/$15/M)  = $0.1531  (x1.98 cheaper)
```

---

## Step 8 — Review pass (`--with-review N`)

Triggered only when the user passes `--with-review N` to `/vibe`. Runs after Step 5 confirms exit 0.

### 8.1 — Read the diff

Run `git diff` (or `git diff HEAD` if changes are staged). Read the full output. This is Claude's review input — do not ask Vibe to review.

### 8.2 — Classify issues

Scan only for **fundamental issues**. Flag these:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Incorrect logic | off-by-one, wrong branch condition, inverted boolean |
| Crash-causing gap | unhandled None/null dereference, missing required field, index out of range |
| Broken contract | function signature changed without updating callers, return type mismatch |
| Wrong scope | change applied to wrong file/function/class |
| Security hole | unsanitized user input passed to shell/SQL/eval, credentials in plaintext |

**Do NOT flag:** style, naming, formatting, unused imports, performance, readability, or subjective preferences. If unsure whether an issue is fundamental, skip it.

### 8.3 — Re-delegate one issue per iteration

For each fundamental issue found (up to N):

1. Write one atomic Vibe prompt targeting that single issue (follow Step 3 rules).
2. Launch via `vibe-delegate` (same workdir, same model).
3. After Vibe finishes, re-read the diff and re-evaluate: did the issue get fixed?
4. Move to the next issue (or stop if N exhausted or no issues remain).

**Never bundle two fixes into one prompt.** One issue → one delegation → one diff check.

If N iterations are exhausted and issues remain, list them but do not attempt further fixes — report and stop.

### 8.4 — Tracking state across iterations

Maintain these counters locally (not persisted mid-run):

```
review_iterations_allowed  = N
review_iterations_used     = 0
review_issues_found        = <count from initial diff review>
review_issues_fixed        = 0
review_issues_remaining    = review_issues_found
```

Increment `review_iterations_used` and `review_issues_fixed` after each successful re-delegation. Update `review_issues_remaining` accordingly.

### 8.5 — Report

After all iterations or no issues remain, append to the Step 7 report:

```
Review pass (--with-review N):
  Issues found:     X
  Issues fixed:     Y
  Issues remaining: Z
  Iterations used:  A / N
```

If issues remain, list each one briefly (file:line — description). Do not re-attempt them.

### 8.6 — Log fields

After the review pass, the run log entry for the **original** Vibe run must include these additional fields in `~/.local/share/delegate-runs.jsonl`:

```json
"review_iterations_allowed": N,
"review_iterations_used": A,
"review_issues_found": X,
"review_issues_fixed": Y,
"review_issues_remaining": Z
```

When `--with-review` is not used, all five fields are omitted (do not write them as 0).

---

## Orchestration rules

- **Decompose before delegating** — one task, one prompt.
- **Streaming always** — never `--output text`.
- **Check diff between sub-tasks** — never launch the next one blind.
- **Never ghostwrite** — do not write code yourself and pass it to Vibe as content. On WROTE_NOTHING or failed write, follow the retry/escalation rules in Step 6. Only permitted with `--allow-ghostwriting`, which must be declared in the Step 7 report.
- **Max 12 turns per call** — decompose instead of extending.
- **Grep target before delegating** — `grep -n "exact_target" file.py` before any `search_replace` prompt. Pass that anchor as `--require "exact_target"` so the delegate aborts before launching if it's gone. Always use grep for VERIFY, not file re-read.
- **Match model to task** — inline-edit tasks → `deepseek-flash` or `mistral-medium-3.5`; never route edits to agent-mode `devstral-small` (read/explore only).
- **UTF-8 / emoji in the prompt** → the script handles it via temp file, but test with a short prompt first.
- **UTF-8 in OLD/NEW strings → mandate python3, no exceptions** — before writing any Vibe prompt, scan every OLD and NEW string for accented chars (é è à ç ù ô î û ñ...) or emoji. If ANY are present, the prompt MUST explicitly instruct Vibe to use `python3 -c` with `pathlib.Path.read_text/write_text(encoding='utf-8')` for those changes — never `search_replace`. A `search_replace [OK]` on UTF-8 content is a silent no-op: the tool call is accepted but the string is never found. This is the #1 cause of phantom successful runs that changed nothing.
- **Check string delimiters before delegating JS/JSON changes** — if a replacement value contains apostrophes (`'`) and the target JS property uses single-quote delimiters, the NEW string must switch to double-quotes (`"`) for that property. Scan OLD→NEW pairs for this conflict before writing the prompt; never leave it to Vibe to discover at runtime.
- **After any run that touches imports: grep the import line** — always run `grep "^from X import" file.py` before the next sub-task.
- **search_replace [OK] ≠ correct change** — always grep the specific changed line, not just check syntax.
- **Provide data structure context** — if a route accesses a DB payload, include the exact field paths (`payload['produit']['nom']`) in the prompt.
- **Reuse existing assets** — for UI tasks, tell Vibe to link existing CSS/JS files. "Use `/static/style.css` and CSS class `bar-row`" is always better than "generate a dark theme".

---

## Run Log

Every run appends one JSON entry to `~/.local/share/delegate-runs.jsonl`.
Log fields and jq queries → see `SKILL-reference.md`.

```bash
~/tools/delegate-report                  # vibe runs only (default)
~/tools/delegate-report --since 7        # last 7 days
~/tools/delegate-report --project myapp  # filter by project
~/tools/delegate-report --fails          # failures only
~/tools/delegate-report --adapt          # failure rates by prompt adaptation
~/tools/delegate-report --all            # all delegates (shared log)
~/tools/delegate-report --delegate opencode  # a specific delegate
```

Or via Claude Code: `/vibe-report [args]`. Log fields and jq queries → `SKILL-reference.md`.

**Review pass fields** — see §8.6 for log field definitions. Present only when `--with-review N` was used.
