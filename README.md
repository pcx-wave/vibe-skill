**Claude orchestrates. Vibe does the heavy lifting. You review the diff, save tokens, costs and avoid hitting limits!**

Claude sees only ≈500–1500 tokens per run regardless of how many file reads Vibe performs internally — massive savings on exploratory and implementation tasks.

Note that Vibe works natively with Mistral models which are capable and significantly cheaper than Claude, but Vibe can also be configured to use any other provider/model instead. Eg you can use a deepseek model with vibe tooling. 

Summary:
1. User types `/vibe <instruction>` in Claude Code
2. Claude decomposes the task and writes a prompt
3. `vibe-delegate` runs Mistral Vibe in a pseudo-TTY
4. The delegate reports tool calls, token counts, and `git diff --stat`
5. Claude reviews the diff and summarizes the result

---

## Why

**Cost savings** — Vibe's file reads and edits consume cheap delegate tokens (or whatever model you configure), not Claude tokens:

| Scenario | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Mistral Medium 3.5 | DeepSeek V4 Flash |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Simple 1-file tweak (800 tokens) | ≈$0.004 | ≈$0.002 | ≈$0.0001 |
| 6-read implementation task (4,800 tokens) | ≈$0.023 | ≈$0.012 | ≈$0.0008 |
| Complex multi-file refactor (12,000 tokens) | ≈$0.058 | ≈$0.029 | ≈$0.002 |

> Costs based on official pricing (May 2026): Claude $3/$15 per M tokens, Mistral Medium 3.5 $1.50/$7.50, DeepSeek V4 Flash $0.14/$0.28. Assumes ≈85% input / 15% output, typical for coding tasks. Claude orchestration overhead: ≈500 tokens per run (negligible).

> **Delegation does cost Claude tokens** — writing the prompt and reading the diff back. But the real lever is context: when Claude does the work directly, every file read accumulates in its context and is re-read on every subsequent turn. When Vibe does it, none of that enters Claude's context at all. Measured breakeven: **≈4 source files touched per task**. Below that, direct is cheaper. Above it, delegation wins by a growing margin (+66% at 10 files, +89% at 30 files). See [handoff-probe/ECONOMICS.md](https://github.com/pcx-wave/handoff-probe/blob/main/ECONOMICS.md) for the full analysis.

> **Le Chat Pro users:** Mistral Vibe is included in the [Le Chat Pro](https://mistral.ai/pricing) subscription (≈$18/mo). Mistral does not publicly document the exact usage limits, but community reports suggest ≈1–1.5B tokens/month are included. Within that allowance every delegation costs $0 in API fees — cheaper than any paid model.

### Delegation synthesis — as of 2026-06-08

Snapshot over **2,450 vibe delegations**, 2026-05-12 → 2026-06-08 (28 days). Pulled from the shared run log via `delegate-report` (vibe scope).

**Performance & savings**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Delegations | 2,450 |
| Tokens delegated | 155.2M |
| Exit-success rate | 79% |
| Avg run duration | 32s |
| **Real cost (with sub)** | **$0 Mistral (Le Chat Pro ~$18/mo) + $0.67 DeepSeek** |
| Mistral at API rate (no sub) | ~$37 |
| Same workload on Claude Sonnet 4.6 | ~$139 (cache-aware, 90.5% hit rate) |

**By model**

| Model | Runs | Exit-ok | Tokens | With sub | API ref (no sub) | vs Claude |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mistral (Le Chat Pro) | 1,911 | 78% | 111.9M | $0 | ~$37 | ~$101 |
| deepseek-flash | 369 | 88% | 35.5M | $0.67 | $0.67 | ~$32 |

> Real cost methodology: All Mistral runs (mistral-medium-3.5 + Le Chat interface) covered by Le Chat Pro subscription — $0 marginal cost. DeepSeek $0.67 is actual spend (from logs). Hit rate of 90.5% back-calculated from that spend. Claude equivalent applies the same hit rate with Claude's cache pricing ($0.30/M hits, $3/M misses, $15/M output), assuming 97.6% input / 2.4% output split.

`deepseek-flash` is the value pick (88% exit-ok at ≈$0.0025/run).

**Error rate** (real projects, 1,964 runs — synthetic test scaffolds excluded)

| Class | Rate | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| clean ok | 67.1% | completed and wrote files |
| `exit_error` | 18.7% | engaged (≈7 tool calls) then exited non-zero, **95% wrote nothing** |
| `wrote_nothing` | 7.1% | tool calls but 0 files, exit 0 |
| `warn_only` | 2.5% | non-fatal warnings, usually fine |
| `sr_fail` | 2.4% | `search_replace` byte-match miss (accents, backticks) |
| `near_empty` | 1.6% | <50 tokens out, nothing written |
| `syntax_error` | 0.4% | wrote invalid code (caught by post-run gate) |
| `timeout` | 0.3% | task too large / context saturated |

The 26% `exit_error` + `wrote_nothing` share one root cause: `search_replace` anchor not found byte-for-byte and the run abandons. The `--require` gate aborts these before they waste tokens.

**Versus the other delegate (`opencode`)**

| | vibe | opencode |
|---|---|---|
| Runs | 2,450 | 254 |
| Tokens | 155.2M | 8.5M |
| Exit-ok | 79% | 81% |
| Real cost | $0.67 + ~$18/mo sub | $0 (free tiers) |
| Models | mistral-medium, deepseek-flash (paid, capable) | free deepseek / mimo / nemotron tiers |

Same headline exit-rate, very different profile: `opencode` runs free tiers at zero cost but with high `silent_exit` and timeout rates. Use it for cheap exploration; vibe's paid models are the choice when the edit has to land. Both write to the same log — `/vibe-report --all` compares them.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pcx-wave/vibe-skill.git && cd vibe-skill && mkdir -p ~/tools ~/.claude/skills/vibe ~/.claude/skills/vibeon ~/.claude/skills/vibeoff ~/.claude/skills/vibestatus ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-pick ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-clear ~/.claude/skills/vibe-report && ln -sf "$(pwd)/tools/vibe-delegate" ~/tools/vibe-delegate && ln -sf "$(pwd)/tools/delegate-report" ~/tools/delegate-report && chmod +x ~/tools/vibe-delegate ~/tools/delegate-report && ln -sf "$(pwd)/SKILL.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe/SKILL.md && ln -sf "$(pwd)/SKILL-reference.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe/SKILL-reference.md && ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBEON.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibeon/SKILL.md && ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBEOFF.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibeoff/SKILL.md && ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBESTATUS.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibestatus/SKILL.md && ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBE-MODEL-PICK.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-pick/SKILL.md && ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBE-MODEL-CLEAR.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-clear/SKILL.md && ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBE-REPORT.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe-report/SKILL.md
```

### Step-by-step

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/pcx-wave/vibe-skill.git
cd vibe-skill

# 2. Install the scripts (symlinks — stay in sync with git pull)
mkdir -p ~/tools
ln -sf "$(pwd)/tools/vibe-delegate" ~/tools/vibe-delegate
ln -sf "$(pwd)/tools/delegate-report" ~/tools/delegate-report
chmod +x ~/tools/vibe-delegate ~/tools/delegate-report

# 3. Install the skills for Claude Code
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/vibe ~/.claude/skills/vibeon ~/.claude/skills/vibeoff ~/.claude/skills/vibestatus \
         ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-pick ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-clear ~/.claude/skills/vibe-report
ln -sf "$(pwd)/SKILL.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe/SKILL.md
ln -sf "$(pwd)/SKILL-reference.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe/SKILL-reference.md
ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBEON.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibeon/SKILL.md
ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBEOFF.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibeoff/SKILL.md
ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBESTATUS.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibestatus/SKILL.md
ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBE-MODEL-PICK.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-pick/SKILL.md
ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBE-MODEL-CLEAR.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe-model-clear/SKILL.md
ln -sf "$(pwd)/VIBE-REPORT.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe-report/SKILL.md

# 4. (Optional) Enable auto-mode — Claude delegates all code tasks automatically
#    without requiring /vibe each time. Toggle with /vibeon and /vibeoff.
grep -q "vibe auto-mode" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || cat >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'

# vibe auto-mode
At the start of every user request that involves writing, editing, or fixing code:
1. Run `test -f ~/.local/share/vibe-auto.flag` (silent, no output to user).
2. If the flag exists → automatically invoke the `vibe` skill exactly as if the user had typed `/vibe <their full instruction>`. Do NOT ask first, do NOT explain — just delegate.
3. If the flag is absent → proceed normally.

The flag is toggled by `/vibeon` and `/vibeoff`.
EOF

```

Verify with `~/tools/vibe-delegate /tmp "Say hello in one sentence." 3`

### Updating

Because both installs use symlinks, a `git pull` is all you need:

```bash
cd ~/vibe-skill && git pull
```

`~/tools/vibe-delegate` and `~/.claude/skills/vibe/SKILL.md` are automatically up to date — no re-copy needed.

> **Migrating from a previous `cp`-based install?** Replace the copies with symlinks:
> ```bash
> cd ~/vibe-skill
> ln -sf "$(pwd)/tools/vibe-delegate" ~/tools/vibe-delegate
> ln -sf "$(pwd)/SKILL.md" ~/.claude/skills/vibe/SKILL.md
> ```

---

## Usage

In a Claude Code session:

```
/vibe add a dark mode toggle to the settings page
```

```
/vibe the login form is not validating the email field — fix it
```

```
/vibe add pagination to the GET /posts route, 20 items per page
```

Claude decomposes the task, writes the Vibe prompt, supervises execution, and reports the diff.

### Flags

All optional — the no-flag path stays the default and lightest:

```
/vibe --with-review N <instruction>      — Claude reviews Vibe's diff and re-delegates fixes up to N times
/vibe --verbose <instruction>            — print per-model token/cost breakdown when done
/vibe --no-ghostwrite <instruction>      — halt on repeated Vibe write failures instead of finishing
```

- **`--with-review N`** — after Vibe finishes, Claude takes a reviewer pass over the changes and re-delegates a fix for each fundamental issue (logic/crash/contract/scope/security only — not style), up to N iterations. Trades Claude tokens for less manual review.
- **`--verbose`** — prints the token/cost block per model: I/O with the coder model (e.g. Mistral), the total, and the projected Claude-token cost it spared.
- **`--no-ghostwrite`** — by default, if Vibe writes nothing after 3 retries, Claude finishes the task itself (ghostwrite fallback) so the run never strands — ghostwritten files are reported separately. `--no-ghostwrite` disables that fallback: after 3 failed attempts Claude halts and asks you (retry / abort) instead.

### Model selection

By default, Vibe uses whatever `active_model` is set in `~/.vibe/config.toml`. You can override it per-session without touching that file:

```
/vibe-model-pick              — interactive menu built from your config.toml models
/vibe-model-pick devstral-small  — switch directly by alias
/vibe-model-clear             — remove the override, return to config default
/vibestatus                   — shows both auto-mode state and active model override
```

`/vibe-model-pick` only lists models that already exist in `~/.vibe/config.toml`. To use a model that isn't there yet, you have to add it first — e.g. to add DeepSeek:

1. Add a `[[providers]]` block with the API endpoint and the env var holding the key (never put the key itself in the file):

   ```toml
   [[providers]]
   name = "deepseek"
   api_key_env_var = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
   api_base = "https://api.deepseek.com"
   api_style = "openai"
   backend = "generic"
   ```

2. Add a `[[models]]` block pointing at that provider, with an `alias` you'll use to select it:

   ```toml
   [[models]]
   name = "deepseek-v4-flash"
   provider = "deepseek"
   alias = "deepseek-flash"
   temperature = 0.7
   input_price = 0.14
   output_price = 0.28
   ```

3. Export the key in your shell env: `export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...`

4. Either set `active_model = "deepseek-flash"` at the top of `config.toml` to make it the permanent default, or run `/vibe-model-pick deepseek-flash` to use it for the current session only.

`input_price`/`output_price` are only used for Vibe's own cost-tracking display — they're optional and don't affect functionality.

The override is stored in `~/.local/share/vibe-model.flag` and is picked up by `vibe-delegate` on every run. It persists across sessions until you clear it.

### Vibe-auto mode

For frictionless delegation, enable auto-mode once in your Claude Code session:

```
/vibeon      — every code request is automatically delegated to Vibe, no /vibe prefix needed
/vibeoff     — return to normal Claude behaviour
/vibestatus  — auto-mode state + active model override
```

With `vibeon` active, just talk to Claude normally:

```
add pagination to the /posts route
fix the broken email validation
refactor the auth middleware into its own module
```

Claude intercepts code requests and applies a pre-filter before delegating:

| Task | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 file, ≤10 lines, exact location known | Claude edits directly — no delegation overhead |
| Everything else | Delegated to Vibe |

Pure questions and conversations always go directly to Claude.

## How vibe-delegate works

```
Claude Code
  └─ /vibe <instruction>
       └─ SKILL.md logic
            └─ ~/tools/vibe-delegate <workdir> <prompt> [turns] [agent] [timeout]
                 ├─ writes prompt to temp file (avoids shell injection with UTF-8/emoji)
                 ├─ generates a temp shell script for the vibe command
                 ├─ runs: python3 -c 'pty.spawn(<vibe-script>)'
                 │         └─ allocates pseudo-TTY (required — vibe hangs without one)
                 ├─ pipes JSON streaming output through Python parser
                 │         └─ prints [read] / [write] / [WARN] / [vibe] lines
                 ├─ reads real token counts from Mistral session log
                 ├─ runs syntax checks on modified .py and .js files
                 ├─ prints git diff --stat
                 └─ appends JSON entry to ~/.local/share/delegate-runs.jsonl
```

## Examples

- `examples/good-prompts.md` — prompt patterns that reliably work
- `examples/anti-patterns.md` — what fails and why, with fixes

---

## Sister project

A parallel delegate using **Gemini CLI** is available at [pcx-wave/gemini-skill](https://github.com/pcx-wave/gemini-skill). Same orchestration pattern, same run log format — different model and trade-offs.

## Reporting

Every run is logged to `~/.local/share/delegate-runs.jsonl` with tokens, cost, model, and failure details. Query it with `~/tools/delegate-report [--since N] [--project NAME] [--fails]` or from Claude Code: `/vibe-report [args]`.

The log is shared with sister delegates (e.g. gemini-skill), so the report defaults to **vibe runs only**. Use `--all` for the cross-delegate comparison, or `--delegate NAME` to scope to another tool.

## Feedback

See [`docs/feedback-claude-sonnet.md`](docs/feedback-claude-sonnet.md) for original feedback from Claude after hours of practice that drove the iterations on `vibe-delegate` — real bugs hit, root causes, and the fixes applied.
